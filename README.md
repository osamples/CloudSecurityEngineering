# CloudSecurityEngineering

You will find the engineering documentation associated with my time working as a data scientist in cloud security. 

## Documentation
This documentation consists of enabling AWS' graph dabase tool (Neptune) for data customization ingestion from relational datasets. It also describes the enablement of Neptune ML which uses AWS Sagemaker to perform ML on the graph database. 

These documentation sources only provide enablement steps. The machine learning associated with these implementations was confidential, but you can discover generic examples [here](https://github.com/aws/graph-notebook/tree/main/src/graph_notebook/notebooks).
